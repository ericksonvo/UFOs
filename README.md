# UFOs
Using javascript and HTML, a website for UFO sightings has been created. The website includes filter search bars to help UFO ethusiast hone in on what interests them most. The search filters includes datetime, cities, state, country and shape of UFO sightings.. However, the country seach bar is limited to only US sightings. Other data that can be found are duration of the sightings as well as comments of what was being seen at the given event.

## Results:
  Here are some step to step directions to help navigate through the UFO sightings website.

  When you first visit the website, you see on the homepage, a section on the left hand side that says "Filter search" an image below shows an example of what it should look like.

Once the Filter search has been located users are able to filter their search to what interests them most. For example if the user is interested in the state of new york and the shape to be flash on the date of 01/04/2010. The user can input "ny" under Enter State: and "flash under Enter Shape: and the date 1/4/2010 under Enter Date: .

## Summary
Although UFO enthusiast may have a wonderful experience using our new website. It does have its drawbacks. One of its drawbacks is that it does not have a clear button for the search. So if users would like to make a new search, they would have to refresh the page or press the UFO sightings text. Two recommendations that could improve the website is 1. To add an clear all button to the search box for faster access to data and 2. Possible implement ways to have the search by other variables. For example, if we wanted to search for January. Users would be able to input January in the search box and all January data would be outputted.
